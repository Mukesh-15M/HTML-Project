    <center><h1>Language</h1></center>
    <p>Language, a structured system of communication, is fundamental to human interaction 
and culture. It encompasses spoken, signed, and written forms, allowing humans to convey meaning, express identity, and explore the world. Language is characterized by its grammar, vocabulary, and the ability to create an infinite 
number of sentences.</p>
<h2>Key Components of Language:</h2>

<p><h3>Grammar:</h3> The set of rules that govern how words are combined to form meaningful phrases and sentences. 
<h3>Vocabulary:</h3>  The collection of words used in a language. 
<h3>Phonetics and Phonology:</h3>  The study of speech sounds and how they are organized in a language.
<h3>Semantics:</h3>  The study of meaning in language.</p>
<h3>Some of the Spoking languages in the world:</h3>
<p><u style=color:pink>Tamil</u> is a classical Dravidian language, recognized as one of the world's longest-surviving languages with a continuous literary history of approximately 2,500 years. It is primarily spoken in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, but also by significant communities in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore, and has a global diaspora. The language boasts unique features, including a complex phonetic system and a rich literary tradition, and holds official status in several countries and regions.
The earliest Tamil writing is attested in inscriptions and potsherds from the 5th century bce. 
Three periods have been distinguished through analyses of grammatical and lexical changes: Old Tamil (from about 450 bce to 700 ce), Middle Tamil (700–1600), and Modern Tamil (from 1600). The Tamil writing system evolved from the Brahmi script. The shape of the letters changed enormously over time, eventually stabilizing when printing was introduced in the 16th century ce. The major addition to the alphabet was the incorporation of Grantha letters to write unassimilated Sanskrit words, although a few letters with irregular shapes were standardized during the modern period.
 A script known as Vatteluttu (“Round Script”) is also in common use.</u></p>
 <p><u style="color:pink">Mandarin Chinese</u> is the most widely spoken variant of Chinese and the official language of China, serving as the standard for government, education, and media.
     Also known as Putonghua ("common language"), it is based on the Beijing dialect and forms the basis for Modern Standard Chinese. While "Chinese" can refer to the broader language family, Mandarin is a specific, major dialect spoken across a large part of China. </p>
<p><u style="color:pink">English</u> is a West Germanic, Indo-European language originating in Britain, known as the global lingua franca and the most widely spoken language in the world.
     It is a complex system of conventional spoken, signed, or written symbols that human beings use for communication, expressing ideas, and participating in culture. 
    English is characterized by its extensive vocabulary, which has incorporated words from many other languages, and its relatively straightforward subject-verb-object (SVO) sentence structure. </p>
<p><u style=color:pink>Russian</u>Russian is a Slavic language, primarily spoken in Russia and other Eastern European and Central Asian countries. It's the official language of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.
     It is also widely spoken in Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, and other Slavic countries. 
    Russian is written using the Cyrillic alphabet.</p>
